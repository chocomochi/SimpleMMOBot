# SimpleMMO Bot

An auto-traveller script with captcha verification using Telegram's API.

The script currently requires the user's cookie in order for it to run; the cookie can be obtained via a web browser. Additionally, using the script with telegram integrations requires both **chat id** and **bot token**. All these essential requirements should be imported inside the **.env** file (see the .env template).

### Guide to installation 
* Download/clone this repository to your environment and install the requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Run the script
```
python main.py --help
```
